README: 
Flutter CRUD App with JSONPlaceholder

This project is a simple Flutter application demonstrating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using the JSONPlaceholder public REST API. 
It showcases fundamental Flutter development practices, including network requests, state management, and user interface design.

Features
View Posts: See a list of all posts retrieved from JSONPlaceholder.

Add Post: Create a new post and submit it to the API.

Edit Post: Modify an existing post's details.

Delete Post: Remove a post from the list.

Loading Indicators: Provides visual feedback during API calls.

Error Handling: Gracefully handles network errors and displays informative messages.

Clean UI: Simple and intuitive user interface for easy interaction.

Technologies Used
Flutter: The UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

http package: For making network requests to the JSONPlaceholder API.

Implementation Details
This application is structured to demonstrate clear separation of concerns.

lib/models/post.dart: Defines the Post data model.

lib/services/post_services.dart: Handles all API interactions, encapsulating the network logic for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting posts.

lib/interfaces/homepage.dart: Displays the list of posts and allows users to add, delete and edit post details.

Error handling is implemented using try-catch blocks around API calls, providing user-friendly messages for network issues or server responses. Loading indicators are displayed (e.g., CircularProgressIndicator) to enhance the user experience during asynchronous operations.

Note on JSONPlaceholder
JSONPlaceholder is a mock API and it simulates successful CRUD operations and returns valid responses
